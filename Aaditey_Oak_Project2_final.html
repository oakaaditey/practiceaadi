                <p> The Taj Mahal in India is one of the most romantic buildings in the world. Shah Jahan
                     started its construction in 1631 to honor the memory of his third wife, whom he 
                     loved dearly.
                     Besides being a monument to eternal love, the Taj Mahal is also a very mysteriou
                     s place. It hides numerous sealed rooms where no one is allowed to go.
                     The Great Sphinx of Giza is the largest monolith statue in the world. It's 66 ft
                      in height, 62 ft in width, and 240 ft in length. According to scientific estimates
                      , this construction was built about 4,500 years ago! 
                     With the help of a seismograph, researchers discovered 
                     2 rectangular chambers at a depth of 25 ft. These rooms are situated underground, 
                     right under the Sphinx's paws.
                     Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple is a real pearl of the Indian state of Kerala.
                      Underneath the temple, there are 6 vaults named A, B, C, D, E, and F. 
                      The doors leading to these chambers are massive and made of iron. 
                    Many people believe that a fatal curse protects the door leading to this 
                    chamber. Hypothetically, this curse can be removed if a saint or sage chants a 
                    spefic mantra in a proper way.
                     In central China, buried deep under a hill and surrounded by poisonous mercury,
                      the First Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, has been lying undisturbed for more
                       than 2,000 years. 
                    Sima Qian, the Han dynasty historian, wrote in his "Records of the Grand Historian"
                     that in Qin Shi Huang's tomb, there were scenic towers and palaces for hundreds of
                      officials. 
                    Streams and rivers of liquid mercury surrounded Qin Shi Huang's tomb. The biggest
                    2 represented the Yellow River and the Yangtze, the major rivers of China.Did ancient
                     builders create all these carvings merely for religious or spiritual reasons, or did 
                     they carve them for a practical, scientific purpose? What if we re-create this 
                     information? So I started to re-create these carvings physically, with the help of 
                     volunteers. So I took 2 strings, placed them exactly as shown in this carving, and 
                     then pulled the ends. See what happened there. This is a knot, an actual knot. 
                     This is called a square knot or a reef knot. And then, it clicked.  This finished knot is also carved in the next pillar in the same temple. Now even more strange, we dont even see the carvings of the beginning and the end stages, we see step by step procedure of how to make this knot in carvings. What you are seeing 
                    is an ancient step-by-step manual of how to tie the square or reef knot.  </p>
